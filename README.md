# Star Verte LLC Coding Standards

Version: 0.1

The purpose of the Star Verte LLC Coding Standards is to create a baseline for collaboration and review within various aspects of Star Verte's open source projects.

These standards are largely based on [@mdo's Code Guide](http://github.com/mdo/code-guide), but is superceded by [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/) because many of Star Verte's open source projects are for use with WordPress.
